 other backward castes and muslims and sikhs in their ghettoes liberalism and capitalism and appeal to religion and what in india is termed communalism all adds up to fascism of hindu elites as they give themselves power and money thus the 38% of voters who voted for the bjp in 2014 became the enemy of the constitution in any case the rot had already set in with nehru when he illegally disbanded the jammu and kashmir constituent assembly 
 narendra modi managed to keep the taint of corruption away from himself personally in the 2014 election campaign and even managed to protect amit shah who had engaged in multiple political assassinations to get himself and narendra modi to power he thus succeeded manmohan singh as prime minister in 2014 
 hence the investigations into the deaths of those students are also deadly slow the nexus between the bjp state government and central government and the police is allencompassing 
 released without charge several bjp strongmen including the exchief minister of karnataka yeddiyurappa from prison this is the mafia gang originally established by the congress chief minister smkrishna to rob the people of bellary district of their agricultural livelihood by establishing mining industries narendra modi released him and yediyurappa is now free to win back karnataka for the bjp from the ruling congress party his associate in crime

000 a year means a jewish state in all of palestine 30 
 we are those attacked and who are on the defensive but in the political field we are the attackers and the arabs are those defending themselves they are living in the country and own the land
 but what does that matter to them our god is not theirs we come from israel
 some additional historical background helps illuminate the context in which resolution 181 was adopted
 british foreign secretary lord arthur james balfour sent a letter to financier and representative of the zionist movement lord lionel walter rothschild that contained a declaration approved by the british cabinet the declaration read 
 president woodrow wilson outlined his ourteen points
 because the substitution of jewish for arab labour would alienate the arabs
 and which have been brought to notice forcibly and frequently during the course of this enquiry
 will succeed in extending its principles to all the jewish colonies in palestine the arab population already regards the transfer of lands to zionist hands with dismay and alarm these cannot be dismissed as baseless in the light of the zionist policy 49 
 there were incentives not to register
 found that by admitting the overlordship of the sultan or of some member of the turkish aristocracy
 which included the largest jewish population center
 the unscop report explicitly rejected the right of the arab palestinians to selfdetermination the rinciple of selfdeterminationwas ot applied to palestine
 arabs owned more land than jews and much of this fighting took place in arab villages and towns located within that same armarkedterritory 
 morris repeatslthough he grants that he mainstream zionist leaders
 randomly blowing up houses with the occupants sleeping inside
 and haifa most of the violence was initiated by the arabs arab snipers continuously fired at jewish houses
 they lived topographically above the arab neighbourhoods and could easily shell and snipe at them they had started doing this frequently since early december they used other methods of intimidation as well the jewish troops rolled barrels full of explosives
 to decide on each village fate emphasis added estruction and expulsion or occupation the plan explicitly called for the destruction of resisting arab villages and the expulsion of their inhabitants 67

president putin asks us to stop provoking russia
 and we are grateful to them for this our cooperation was very efficient here
 the situation is not bad
 say in black and white hirty days after the signing of the minsk agreements ukraine rada must adopt a resolution outlining the geographical boundaries of areas where the law on the special status of these unrecognised republics would become effective immediatelybecause the only thing needed for it to work was the description of those geographical boundaries 
 even if past the deadline so one would think that this law was to take effect immediately it was passed
 everything could have ended then and there a year ago in paris
 i expressed my agreement and said we would settle the matter with donetsk and lugansk
 or we would never reach an agreement but we agreed to bundle the nuances and details of how it would be implemented together with the concept you spoke about
 but we have no other option
 that nato troops should withdraw to the level that they were before 2000 in europe; secondly
 when she reestablishes highlevel relations with the kremlin thank you 
 we suspended it why did we do this what were this agreement provisions under its terms
 russia would be foolish not to make use of its geographical advantages and develop ties with its neighbours 
 vietnam and other countries in the region these ties are extensive and promising 
 how would you describe the relations between the two countries thank you very much 
 but they asked me to tell you that they would be happy to see you any time
 where there are also many conflicts or potential conflict situations 
 we have a multivector policy this is not just in virtue of our geographical location our policy with regard to our partners is built on the basis of equality and mutual respect 
 as far as i know there are a few problems there concerning nonreturn of vat
 you would have a free hand can you recall this conversation it is very important for the history of what is taking place in syria now 
 they recognised that part of aleppo is occupied by terrorist organisations isis and jabhat alnusra we can see this for ourselves from the news reports
 and we and our american partners would target the terrorists they made repeated promises these promises were made at the level of our defence ministers
 said that we would go with their proposal
 and this was followed by an isis offensive we were told that the strike was a mistake and that the isis offensive was only a coincidence perhaps this is so
 and the use of weapons against them when they are not armed is absolutely unacceptable and will be seen as the least acceptable behaviour this is their power
 all parties have agreed that it can be done
 from your point of view
 national and geopolitical interests could we have done things differently yes
 but with the participation of the united states in order to balance the system out he went on to say that if we fail to do so
 and russia and other important european countries it was the time before the economic crisis; growth rates were bigger it was even the time before the introduction of the euro; the euro is very important
